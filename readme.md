# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game supports two players taking turns to make their moves and determines the winner or declares a tie based on the traditional rules of Tic Tac Toe.

## How to Play

1. **Set Up the Game:**
   - Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
   - The game initializes an empty 3x3 board.

2. **Players' Turns:**
   - Players take turns making moves.
   - Each player is prompted to enter the row and column (both ranging from 0 to 2) where they want to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').

3. **Winning:**
   - The game checks for a winner after each move.
   - A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

4. **Tie:**
   - If the board is full and no player has won, the game declares a tie.

5. **Game Ends:**
   - The game ends when there is a winner or a tie.
   - The final board is displayed along with the result.
